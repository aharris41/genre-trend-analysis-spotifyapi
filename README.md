This project involved the use of Spotify API and various Python libraries such as requests, Pandas, json, matplotlib, and seaborn to analyze audio features of songs released from 1974 - 2024 across three genres: pop, rap, and country, to see how the genre has progressed over time. Each genre was analyzed separately, with each decade's audio features being stored into their own individual dataframe with respect to their genre. 

To start the project off, an authorization request was made in order to access Spotify API resources, followed by getting a refresh token (to repeatedly enter Spotify API when the original token expires) and a POST request. The bulk of the project mainly came from searching items, where I created a function to search for items such as songs, artists, podcasts, and playlists. To meet the goals of the project, I made it genre specific, where I would pass in the current genre I am looking at and then search for items within that genre. This process involved pagination to effectively retrieve and store tracks in a dataframe.
