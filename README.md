This project involved the use of Spotify API and various Python libraries such as requests, Pandas, json, matplotlib, and seaborn to analyze audio features of songs released from 1974 - 2024 across three genres: pop, rap, and country, to see how the genre has progressed over time. 

Each genre was analyzed separately, with each decade's audio features being stored into their own individual dataframe with respect to their genre.
